## NOTES

To reproduce the code on this Github, you may need to download it and load it via : `source("data-bzh-tools-master/main.R")` 
*** 

Many maps are created using shapefiles you can find here : https://github.com/DataBzh/data-bzh-tools/tree/master/shapefiles
These shapefiles are not our property, but curated from several open data platforms.
